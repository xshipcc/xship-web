- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Displays the status of drones, payload status, communication link status, airport status in real-time, ensuring comprehensive monitoring during task execution.

### 3. **Multi-Role Permission Management**

- **Super Administrator**: Has the highest permissions, can add operators, visitors, etc., and set time limits.
- **Operator**: Has drone operation permissions, can view current tasks, reports, statistics, historical records, and alarm information.
- **Visitor**: Can only view the current flight status and cannot view alarm information, ensuring system security and privacy protection.
- **Operation Log**: All operation histories are kept in log form for easy auditing and tracking.

### 4. **Comprehensive Monitoring and Intelligent Alerting**

- **Drone Status Monitoring**: Displays battery level, navigation strength, attitude, heading, and position of the drone in real-time to ensure flight safety.
- **Payload Status Monitoring**: Monitors payload attitude, zoom ratio, working mode in real-time to ensure accurate task execution.
- **Intelligent Alert System**: Automatically detects and alerts for anomalies such as voltage alerts, navigation signal interruption, communication link interruption, etc. Drones can automatically return to base, ensuring device safety.
- **AI Intelligent Detection**: Integrates AI algorithms to support intelligent alert functions such as personnel detection, vehicle detection, intrusion detection, flame and smoke detection, facial recognition, etc., enhancing the intelligence level of tasks.

### 5. **Task Management and Route Planning**

- **Task Creation and Editing**: Supports the creation and editing of multi-drone patrol routes and flight tasks, with detailed settings for waypoint locations, payload attitudes, and execution algorithms.
- **Route Planning**: Manually plans routes on satellite maps, supports route dragging and editing, and can overlay payload scanning routes, ensuring the accuracy of task execution.
- **Automatic Patrol Tasks**: Drones can autonomously perform patrol tasks based on preset tasks, automatically alerting and allowing operators to manually intervene to observe anomalies.

### 6. **Visual Platform and Real-time Situation Display**

- **Patrol Visualization Platform**: Displays task results such as drone flight time, mileage, and the number of abnormal events in real-time, helping you quickly grasp task progress.
- **Map Real-time Situation Display**: Displays the position, flight path, and real-time photos of the drone in real-time, ensuring full visibility throughout the task.
- **Historical Playback**: Supports synchronized playback of flight routes, flight photos, and alarm information for easy task review and analysis.

### 7. **Third-Party Integration and Expansion**

- **Hikvision Camera Access**: Supports the access and split-screen display of multiple Hikvision monitoring data, ensuring comprehensive monitoring without blind spots.
- **NVR Integration**: Supports third-party NVR services, providing video storage, monitoring, and playback functions, with support for time period selection and synchronized playback.
- **AI Intelligent Platform**: Based on NVIDIA Jetson series boards or GPU servers, provides powerful data processing capabilities, supporting the rapid deployment and operation of AI algorithms.
